## Philosophy

The transformation successfully implements the core philosophy:

**"SPEND CONSCIOUSLY · INVEST PATIENTLY"**

By making expenses the primary focus (homepage) and portfolio a "side objective" (separate page with teaser card), the application encourages:

1. **Daily Discipline**: Track every expense to build awareness
2. **Budget Adherence**: Visual feedback keeps spending in check
3. **Long-term Vision**: Portfolio remains visible but not obsessive
4. **Balanced Approach**: Manage today while building tomorrow

✅ Expenses as homepage (/)

✅ Updated navigation
✅ Expense tracking with 8 categories
✅ Budget management system
✅ Analytics and charts
✅ Portfolio integration card
✅ Preserved design aesthetic
✅ Semantic Tailwind tokens only
✅ Custom themed scrollbar
✅ Scroll-aware blur effects
